#### 1. The 16-bit "Strobe" Split (CTRL8 & CTRL9)

On a 68k CPU board, you will need to map the Upper and Lower Data Strobes to these pins.

- **CTRL8** becomes `/UDS`.    
- **CTRL9** becomes `/LDS`.
    
On 8-bit cards (Z80/6309), these pins can be ignored or tied together to signify a valid byte transfer.
    

#### 2. The Overloaded R/W Logic

For the 6309 and 65816, which use a single `R/W` line:

- **CTRL2** is your primary `R/W`.    
- **CTRL1** (the Read/OE strobe) is typically generated by an inverter or a gate on the CPU board to provide a "clean" output enable signal for the bus.
    

#### 3. The Slot Selects (CTRL20–23)

These are your **Macro-selects**.

- Since you are doing a backplane, your 74HCT138 decoder (likely on the CPU board or near the first slot) will drive these.
    
- **Slot 1** gets CTRL20.    
- **Slot 2** gets CTRL21.    
- **Slot 3** gets CTRL22... and so on.
    

#### 4. The Interrupt Daisy Chain (CTRL17/18)

Since you are using parallel slots:

- Connect the **IEO** (A46) of Slot $N$ to the **IEI** (A45) of Slot $N+1$.    
- This creates the physical priority chain required for the Z80 SIO and CTC chips you mentioned.

### Routing Strategy for the Control Block

Since most of these are on **Side B** (Top Layer):

1. **Ribbon Cable Style:** Route CTRL1 through CTRL14 as a parallel group of traces above the connector pins on the **Top Layer**.
    
2. **Pull-ups:** This is where you place your **Bourns 4820P-2-472LF** resistor networks.
    
3. **Placement:** Put the resistor block at the far end of the ATX board (away from the ATX power connector). This acts as the "terminator" for the control lines.
